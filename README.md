# NoCodeStatsFHE: A Cutting-Edge Tool for Encrypted Data Analysis üìäüîí

NoCodeStatsFHE is an innovative tool that empowers non-technical users, such as social scientists and market analysts, to perform statistical analysis on Fully Homomorphically Encrypted (FHE) datasets without writing a single line of code. This functionality is built on **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, enabling secure and private data analysis across various fields, while ensuring sensitive information remains confidential.

## Addressing the Data Privacy Challenge

In a world where data privacy is paramount, analysts face significant hurdles when processing sensitive data. Traditional data analysis tools require access to unencrypted information, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations. Professionals in fields like social science and market analysis often lack the technical expertise to manage encryption complexities while still needing to derive insights from sensitive data.

## Leveraging FHE to Transform Data Analysis

Fully Homomorphic Encryption, implemented using Zama's open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and the **zama-fhe SDK**, provides a solution to this challenge. By allowing computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, FHE eliminates the need to decrypt sensitive information, preserving privacy throughout the analysis process. NoCodeStatsFHE leverages this powerful technology, offering a graphical interface that simplifies common statistical analyses‚Äîlike regression and clustering‚Äîthrough a user-friendly drag-and-drop canvas.

## Key Features ‚ú®

- **Visual Data Analysis Interface**: Users can easily upload and analyze encrypted data sets using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, eliminating the need for coding skills.
- **Automated FHE Computation**: The backend automatically generates the necessary FHE computations, allowing users to focus on analysis rather than implementation details.
- **Accessibility for Non-Technical Users**: Designed to lower the barriers to data privacy analysis, making it accessible to professionals in numerous fields.
- **Diverse Statistical Methods**: Supports common statistical methodologies, including regression analysis and clustering, all performed on encrypted datasets.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

This project is built upon a robust technology stack, with a particular emphasis on confidentiality and security:

- **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption SDK**  
- **Node.js** for backend development  
- **React** for the frontend interface  
- **Hardhat** for building and deploying smart contracts

## Installation Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è

To get started with NoCodeStatsFHE, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Recommended version 14.x or later.
- **Hardhat**: Ensure you have Hardhat installed for deploying smart contracts.

### Setup Steps

1. **Download the project**: Ensure you have the latest version of the project files.
2. **Install dependencies**: In the root directory of your project, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all necessary packages, including the Zama FHE libraries, for optimal functionality.

## Build & Run Instructions üöÄ

To compile the contracts and start the application, follow these commands:

1. **Compile the smart contract**: Navigate to the `contract` directory and run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. **Run the development server**: From the root directory, execute:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will launch the application, allowing you to interact with the NoCodeStatsFHE tool through your browser.

## Example Usage

Below is a simplified code snippet to demonstrate the main function of NoCodeStatsFHE, showcasing how users can initiate a statistical analysis:

```javascript
import { startStatAnalysis } from './services/statisticsService';

function analyzeData(encryptedData) {
    const analysisResult = startStatAnalysis(encryptedData, 'regression', {target: 'price'});
    console.log('Analysis Result:', analysisResult);
}

// Example encrypted dataset
const encryptedDataset = '...'; // Encapsulated encrypted data
analyzeData(encryptedDataset);
```

In this hypothetical example, `startStatAnalysis` is a function that processes the encrypted dataset using the selected statistical method (regression in this case) and outputs the analysis result.
